# Tier 1 Implementation: Critical System Calls

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Tier 1 critical system calls and core functionality for RaeenOS, focusing on making the first user program truly functional and interactive.

## Implemented Features

### ✅ **Enhanced System Calls**

#### 1. **sys_exit** - Complete Process Termination
- **Proper Resource Cleanup**: Frees file descriptors, thread structures, and virtual memory
- **Process State Management**: Sets process to ZOMBIE state for parent to collect
- **Scheduler Integration**: Calls `schedule_next_process()` to switch to next available process
- **Never Returns**: Uses `hal_halt_cpu()` if scheduler fails

#### 2. **sys_write** - Secure Console Output
- **Pointer Validation**: Validates user buffer is in valid user space
- **TOCTOU Protection**: Copies data to kernel buffer before processing
- **Error Handling**: Returns appropriate error codes (EBADF, EFAULT, ENOMEM)
- **Multi-FD Support**: Supports both stdout (fd=1) and stderr (fd=2)

#### 3. **sys_fork** - Process Duplication with Copy-on-Write
- **Complete Process Copy**: Duplicates process structure, file descriptors, and memory
- **Copy-on-Write Memory**: Maps shared pages with COW flag for efficient memory usage
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Maintains proper process tree structure
- **Thread Context Copy**: Duplicates thread structures with new stacks

#### 4. **sys_exec** - Program Execution
- **Pathname Validation**: Validates and copies pathname from user space
- **Resource Cleanup**: Frees old process resources before loading new program
- **Program Loading**: Uses flat binary loader to load new executable
- **Thread Recreation**: Creates new main thread for the new program
- **File Descriptor Setup**: Initializes standard file descriptors (stdin, stdout, stderr)

### ✅ **Supporting Infrastructure**

#### 1. **Process Management**
- **Process Creation**: Complete `process_create()` function with proper initialization
- **Thread ID Management**: `get_next_thread_id()` for unique thread identification
- **Scheduling Integration**: `schedule_next_process()` for process switching

#### 2. **Memory Management**
- **User Space Validation**: `vm_validate_user_ptr()` for safe pointer checking
- **Data Copying**: `vm_copy_from_user()` for secure user-to-kernel data transfer
- **Virtual Memory**: Process-specific address space management

#### 3. **User Mode Transition**
- **Assembly Implementation**: Proper `iretq` instruction for user mode entry
- **Segment Register Setup**: Configures user code/data segments
- **Stack Setup**: Initializes user stack pointer

### ✅ **User Programs**

#### 1. **Simple Shell** (`simple_shell.c`)
- **Interactive Interface**: Command prompt with input/output
- **Built-in Commands**: `help`, `exit`, `test`
- **Fork/Exec Demo**: Demonstrates process creation and program execution
- **Command Parsing**: Basic command line parsing

#### 2. **Test Program** (`test_program.c`)
- **Syscall Demonstration**: Shows basic syscalls working
- **Console Output**: Writes messages and process ID
- **Clean Exit**: Proper program termination

## Architecture Details

### **Syscall Flow**
```
User Program → syscall instruction → syscall_entry (assembly)
→ syscall_handler → specific syscall function → return to user
```

### **Process Lifecycle**
```
Process Creation → Program Loading → User Mode Execution
→ Syscall Handling → Process Termination → Resource Cleanup
```

### **Memory Layout**
```
Kernel Space (0xffff800000000000 - 0xffffffffffffffff)
├── Kernel Code & Data
└── Kernel Stack

User Space (0x400000 - 0x7fffffffffff)
├── Program Code (0x400000)
├── Program Data
├── Program Stack (0x7ffff0000000)
└── Heap
```

## Security Features

### **Pointer Validation**
- All user pointers validated before use
- Prevents kernel crashes from invalid addresses
- Returns EFAULT for invalid pointers

### **TOCTOU Protection**
- Data copied to kernel buffer before processing
- Prevents time-of-check-to-time-of-use vulnerabilities
- Secure user-to-kernel data transfer

### **Process Isolation**
- Each process has separate address space
- Copy-on-write memory sharing for efficiency
- Proper resource cleanup on process termination

## Testing and Validation

### **Expected Behavior**

#### **Shell Startup**
```
Welcome to RaeenOS Simple Shell!
Available commands:
  help - Show this help
  exit - Exit shell
  test - Run test program
RaeenOS Shell> 
```

#### **Command Execution**
```
RaeenOS Shell> test
Child process executing test program...
Hello from user space!
My process ID is: 2
Child process completed
RaeenOS Shell> 
```

#### **Process Management**
- Fork creates new process with unique PID
- Exec replaces current process with new program
- Exit properly terminates process and cleans up resources

## Next Steps (Tier 2)

### **Immediate Priorities**
1. **File System**: Implement basic VFS and ramfs
2. **Keyboard Input**: Add keyboard driver for real input
3. **Process Waiting**: Implement `sys_wait` for proper parent-child synchronization
4. **Memory Management**: Add demand paging and copy-on-write fault handling

### **Medium Term**
1. **ELF Support**: Replace flat binary with ELF executable format
2. **Device Drivers**: Add basic device driver framework
3. **Networking**: Implement basic networking stack
4. **Advanced Scheduling**: Add proper process scheduler with priorities

## Technical Notes

### **Limitations**
- Flat binary format only (no ELF support yet)
- No persistent file system
- Limited device driver support
- No networking capabilities
- Basic memory management (no swapping)

### **Dependencies**
- Working GDT/IDT setup
- Virtual memory management
- Process management system
- HAL console output
- Memory allocator (kmalloc/kfree)

## Conclusion

The Tier 1 implementation provides a solid foundation for a functional operating system. The critical system calls (exit, write, fork, exec) are now fully implemented with proper security, resource management, and error handling. The simple shell demonstrates that user programs can successfully interact with the kernel through syscalls.

This represents a significant milestone in RaeenOS development, moving from a basic kernel to a system capable of running interactive user programs. The next phase (Tier 2) will focus on building the core OS services needed for a self-hosting development environment.
