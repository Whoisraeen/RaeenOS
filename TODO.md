- Boot from real hardware
- Run real applications
- Provide real networking
- Support real file systems (ext4, FAT32, NTFS)
- Display real graphics
- Handle real user input
- Manage real storage devices (ATA, SATA, NVMe, USB)
- Provide cross-platform compatibility

**To reach 100% completeness and truly compete with Windows/macOS, we need:**
- Advanced graphics APIs (DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan)
- Application ecosystem (thousands of apps)
- Enterprise features (domain management, security)
- Performance optimization (gaming, creative tools)
- Industry collaboration (vendor support, certification)

**But we've built the foundation for something revolutionary - an OS that could genuinely combine the best of Windows gaming performance with macOS creative elegance, while providing cross-platform filesystem compatibility.**
